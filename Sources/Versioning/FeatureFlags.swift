/// A class that manages the lifecycle and availability of feature flags of a target.
///
/// `FeatureFlags` is an observable class that integrates with Combine to notify subscribers of changes
/// to the list of enabled features. It provides functionality for:
/// - Registering feature flags.
/// - Determining the availability of features based on the app version.
/// - Allowing users to override feature availability.
///
/// ### User Overrides
/// User overrides enable explicit control over feature availability. For example:
/// - A feature that is normally disabled can be explicitly enabled by a user.
/// - Similarly, a feature that is enabled by default can be explicitly disabled.
/// Overrides are managed using the `setFeatureOverride` and `clearFeatureOverride` methods, and take precedence
/// over default availability rules defined in the registry.
